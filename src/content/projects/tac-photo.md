## Background

Tac is an open, ongoing project exploring how intuitive, elder-inspired design can shape the next generation of humane technology—starting from the place we know best: home.

The idea for Tac emerged from a series of personal frustrations while helping my grandmother—who lives alone—connect with her family through technology.  
Despite various attempts using smart speakers, displays, and CD players, I found that many advanced devices were too intrusive or confusing.  
These moments led me to rethink what technology should feel like—especially at home.

**Tac Photo** is the first prototype in this exploration.

## Concept

Tac Photo is a **quiet digital photo frame** inspired by the philosophy of **Calm Technology**—technology that fades into the background, offering gentle emotional cues rather than demanding attention.

It is a counterpoint to the hyper-connected “millions sensor society.”  
Instead of rapid updates and algorithmic feeds, Tac Photo presents **pure, slow, intentional photo experiences**—evoking memory and feeling, not just content.

## Design Principles

- 🕊️ **Quiet Presence**  
  The frame does not demand interaction. It simply displays curated photos that naturally draw the viewer’s attention.

- 🧭 **Minimal Ambient Data**  
  A segment LCD subtly shows the photo’s date or place—without stealing focus.

- ✋ **No-Touch Interaction**  
  No touchscreens or voice input. Settings are managed via NFC tags and configuration cards.

- 🖼️ **Photo-Centric Aesthetics**  
  The display looks like a matted print. It blends into the home like an object, not a gadget.

- 🔒 **Privacy-Respecting**  
  Fully offline by default. Users can choose to integrate cloud services without vendor lock-in.

## Key Features

- **Display**: 7" RGB TFT LCD (800×480, non-touch, matte-finished)  
- **Sub-display**: Segment LCD showing EXIF-based metadata (e.g., date, location)  
- **Interaction**: NFC-based config (NTAG215); optional tactile input  
- **Storage**: microSD, with optional support for Google Photos, iCloud, others
