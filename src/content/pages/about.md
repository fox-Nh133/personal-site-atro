## Hello, I’m Mike Nada

I’m passionate about smart home technologies and the philosophy of [Calm Technology](https://calmtech.com/).  
My focus is on creating tools that are minimal yet meaningful—products that quietly support daily life and gradually become beloved through continued use.

### Interests

- **Designing tech like tools** — calm, ambient, and human-centered
- **Low-level systems** — RTOS, scalable OS architecture, microcontrollers
- **Embedded development** — I enjoy building things from the bare metal

### Current Project: Tac Photo

I’m currently developing **Tac Photo**, a minimal digital photo frame designed around calm interaction.  
It uses ESP32-S3 with FreeRTOS, a segment LCD to show EXIF metadata, and NFC-based configuration.  
It’s part of an exploration into tangible, ambient technology that enhances emotion and memory.

> Let tech stay in the background—yet make people feel something.
